# keyloggerPHPJS
<b>KeyloggerPHPJS</b> is a simple keylogger that records user keystrokes on a web page using JavaScript and PHP. This project is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for unauthorized or illegal activities.

## Files

### The project consists of four files:

1. <b>script.js</b>: This file contains the JavaScript script that captures key press events on the web page and sends the data to the server.
2. <b>keylogger.php</b>: This PHP file receives the data sent by the JavaScript script, encrypts it using OpenSSL, and logs it into a log file on the server.
3. <b>decryptdatas.php</b>: This PHP file can be used to decrypt and read the data logged in the log file.
4. <b>encryptionkeys.php</b>: This PHP file contains the encryption keys. Customize it, it's empty

## Usage

1. <b>Configuration</b>: Make sure to properly configure the web server to run PHP scripts and handle HTTP requests.
2. <b>Integration</b>: Include the script.js file in your web page to start capturing keystrokes. Ensure that the keylogger.php file is accessible on your server to receive the captured data.
3. <b>Access Logs</b>: After capturing keystrokes, you can access the log file generated by keylogger.php to view the encrypted data.
4. <b>Decryption</b>: If you want to decrypt the logged data, you can use the decryptdatas.php script by providing the log file name as a command-line argument.
